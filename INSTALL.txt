Gammu C library
===============

As this is a binding to libGammu, it needs to know where to find it in
order to compile the OCaml Library.  On Unix systems supporting
pkg-config, the right flags will be automatically configured.  If
pkg-config does not work or you are on windows, you should look at the
first lines of config.ml and change them to suit your particular platform.

If you know an automatic way of getting the right flags for your
platform, write to us.

installation: no additional library is required.
